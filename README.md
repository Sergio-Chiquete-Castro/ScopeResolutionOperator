# ScopeResolutionOperator


This C++ program defines a Rectangle class with private attributes for length and breadth, provides constructors including a default constructor, a parameterized constructor, and a copy constructor, as well as methods for setting and getting attributes, calculating the area and perimeter of a rectangle, checking if the rectangle is a square, and includes a destructor to print a message when the rectangle object is destroyed, with a demonstration of its usage in the main function.
